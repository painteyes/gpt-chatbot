/*
    An Express server that handles incoming API requests and responds with a JSON object.
    It uses "body-parser" to handle incoming data and "cors" to allow cross-origin requests.
*/

/* 
    The "body-parser" middleware is used to parse the incoming HTTP request body. For example, if an HTTP 
    request contains data sent through the POST or PUT method, the "body-parser" middleware parses the request 
    body and makes it available as a JSON object so that it can be easily manipulated by the application code. 
    This middleware can be configured to parse the request body in various formats such as JSON, URL-encoded, 
    XML, and others.
/*

/*
    The "cors" middleware is used to enable cross-origin HTTP requests (CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). 
    CORS is a security measure implemented in web browsers to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site 
    request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The "cors" middleware is very useful for allowing your web applications to 
    accept HTTP requests from domains other than your own. Without the "cors" middleware, the browser 
    automatically blocks these requests for security reasons. For example, if you are writing an API and a client 
    tries to make an HTTP request to your server from a different domain, the browser will block the request. 
    In this case, the "cors" middleware can be used to configure the application to accept requests from other 
    domains. This way, your application can function properly and communicate with other applications and 
    servers without security issues.
